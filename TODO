Animated gif saving
  Render island bit to a different buffer (always), copy that to regular drawing buffer (always)
  Lerp out of main mode before starting, want to capture gif in zoomed in state.
  Render a progress bar on regular buffer while gif saving takes place.  Remove menu to emphasise non interactability.
  Think about what do do once save is complete, does user need to press something?

Nice camera controls when not in menu
Improve blobs
Improve performance
Investigate improving reflection
Fix compile warnings in windows
Make web page with lots of gifs
